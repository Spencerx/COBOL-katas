*> Your task is to write a program to calculate the next
*> generation of Conway's game of life, given any starting
*> position.

*> You start with a two dimensional grid of cells, where
*> each cell is either alive or dead. The grid is finite,
*> and no life can exist off the edges. When calculating
*> the next generation of the grid, follow these four rules:

*> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours
   *> dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
*> 2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours
   *> dies, as if by overcrowding.
*> 3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours
   *> lives on to the next generation.
*> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours
   *> becomes a live cell.

*> Examples: * indicates live cell, . indicates dead cell

*> Example input: (4 x 8 grid)
*> 4 8
*> ........
*> ....*...
*> ...**...
*> ........

*> Example output:
*> 4 8
*> ........
*> ...**...
*> ...**...
*> ........
